## [Unreleased]
### Added
- `Game::on_close_request` to control whether the game should be closed when the
  window receives a close request by the OS. [#14]
- `input::Event::TextInput` event, which triggers on text entry. Contains the
  character typed as a `char`. [#15]
- `input::Event::CursorEntered` and `input::Event::CursorLeft` events, which
  trigger when the mouse cursor enters or leaves the game window, respectively.
  [#15]
- `input::Event::MouseWheel`, which triggers when the mouse wheel is scrolled.
  Contains the number of horizontal and vertical lines scrolled as `f32`. [#15]
- `input::Event::WindowFocused` and `input::Event::WindowUnfocused`, which
  trigger when the game window gains or loses focus, respectively. [#15]
- `input::Event::WindowMoved`, which triggers when the game window is moved.
  Contains the new X and Y coordinates of the window as `f32`. [#15]
- Text rendering for the [`wgpu`] graphics backend. Vulkan, Metal, D3D11 and
  D3D12 now support text rendering. OpenGL already supported text rendering.
