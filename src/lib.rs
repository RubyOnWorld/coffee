//!
//! # Usage
//! To get started, simply implement the [`Game`] trait. Then, call
//! [`Game::run`] with some [`WindowSettings`] to run your game.
//!
//! Here is a minimal example that will open a window:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use coffee::{Game, Result, Timer};
//! use coffee::graphics::{Color, Window, WindowSettings};
//!
//! fn main() -> Result<()> {
//!     MyGame::run(WindowSettings {
//!         title: String::from("A caffeinated game"),
//!         size: (1280, 1024),
//!         resizable: true,
//!     })
//! }
//!
//! struct MyGame {
//!     // Your game state goes here...
//! }
//!
//! impl Game for MyGame {
//!     type View = (); // No view data.
//!     type Input = (); // No input data.
//!
//!     const TICKS_PER_SECOND: u16 = 60; // Update rate
//!
//!     fn new(_window: &mut Window) -> Result<(MyGame, Self::View, Self::Input)> {
//!         // Load your game assets here. Check out the `load` module!
//!         Ok((MyGame { /* ... */ }, (), ()))
//!     }
//!
//!     fn update(&mut self, _view: &Self::View, _window: &Window) {
//!         // Update your game here
//!     }
//!
//!     fn draw(&self, _view: &mut Self::View, window: &mut Window, _timer: &Timer) {
//!         // Clear the current frame
//!         let mut frame = window.frame();
//!         frame.clear(Color::BLACK);
//!
//!         // Draw your game here. Check out the `graphics` module!
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
