//! Load your game assets with _type-safety_ and build loading screens that can
//! keep track of progress _consistently_.
//!
//! # Tasks
//! The generic [`Task`] struct represents a lazy loading operation that can
//! be combined and composed with other tasks. Most of the types representing
//! resources in Coffee have `load` functions that return a [`Task`].
//!
//! Tasks are defined declaratively in a functional style. This allows them to
//! keep track of all the work they have to complete before even executing them.
//! Read the [`Task`] docs to learn more!
//!
//! # Loading screens
//! The [`LoadingScreen`] trait allows you to implement a loading screen that is
//! compatible with any [`Task`]. Currently, Coffee includes a built-in loading
//! screen: [`ProgressBar`], which shows a simple progress bar with some text.
//!

/// A `Task<T>` represents an operation that produces a value of type `T`.
///
/// # Laziness
/// A [`Task`] is just a recipe that describes how to produce a specific asset.
/// Like functions, they can be combined and run whenever needed.
///
/// Creating a [`Task`] consists in specifying this recipe. For instance,
/// we could define a task to load an `Image` like this:
///
/// ```
/// Task::using_gpu(move |gpu| Image::new(gpu, "my-image.png"))
/// ```
///
/// See? We just _describe_ how to load an image, we do not load it right away.
/// This is how [`Image::load`] works, you should use that instead of writing
/// this over and over!
///
/// # Composition
/// Tasks can be combined easily thanks to the [`Join`] trait.
///
/// Let's say we have a `Task<Image>` and a `Task<TextureArray>`, we can easily
/// obtain a `Task<(Image, TextureArray)>` like this:
///
/// ```
/// let combined_task = (load_image, load_texture_array).join();
/// ```
///
/// You can do this for up to 8 tasks. However, consider grouping task output in
/// meaningful structs using [`map`]:
///
/// ```
/// pub struct PlayerAssets {
///     idle: Image,
///     running: Image,
/// }
///
/// impl PlayerAssets {
///     pub fn load() -> Task<PlayerAssets> {
///         (
///             Image::load("player/idle.png"),
///             Image::load("player/running.png"),
///         )
///             .join()
///             .map(|(idle, running)| PlayerAssets { idle, running });
